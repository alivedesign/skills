# LinkedIn Viral Hook Creation Guide

## Purpose
This document provides all rules, frameworks, and examples needed to generate best-in-class, engaging, viral LinkedIn hooks. A hook is the first 1-3 lines of a LinkedIn post visible before the "see more" button.

---

## Critical Importance of Hooks

**The hook determines approximately 80% of a post's success.**

The hook is the only content users see before deciding to click "see more." A post with a brilliant body but weak hook will fail. A post with a strong hook can succeed even with an average body.

---

## The Three Mandatory Functions of Every Hook

Every effective hook must accomplish all three of these functions simultaneously:

| Function | Description | Test Question |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **1. Trigger Interest** | Create curiosity that compels the reader to click "see more" | Does this make the reader think "I need to know more"? |
| **2. Frame the Content** | Signal clearly what the post is about | Can the reader understand the topic within 2 seconds? |
| **3. Ensure Relevance** | Make the reader feel the content applies to them personally | Does the reader feel "this is about ME"? |

**If a hook fails any one of these three functions, it will underperform.**

## The 12 Hook Archetypes

### 1. UNIQUE TRANSFORMATION HOOK
**Psychology:** Taps into the universal "Cinderella story" desire for rapid, dramatic success.

**Formula:**  
`How I + [specific achievement] + [in timeframe]`

**Requirements:**
- Include a specific, measurable result
- Include a concrete timeframe
- The achievement must be desirable to the target audience

**Examples:**
- "How I got 10,000 leads in 90 days"
- "How I went from $0 to $50K/month in 6 months"
- "How I grew from 500 to 100,000 followers in one year"

**Enhancement (X-Ray Vision Trick):**  
Add relatability by mentioning something the audience doesn't want to sacrifice.  
Format: `How to [achieve goal] without [thing audience doesn't want to give up]`

**Enhanced Examples:**
- "How to lose weight without giving up cake"
- "How I 10x'd my income without working weekends"
- "How to grow on LinkedIn without posting daily"

---

### 2. FAILURE STORY HOOK
**Psychology:** Vulnerability creates trust. Admitting failure makes you human and relatable. Readers are drawn to learn from others' mistakes.

**Formula:**  
`I [failed/messed up/lost] + [specific failure] + [emotional aftermath or scale]`

**Requirements:**
- The failure must be real and specific
- Include an emotional element (humiliation, embarrassment, loss)
- Imply there's a lesson learned

**Examples:**
- "I lost $100,000 on a product no one wanted"
- "I got fired from my dream job. On my birthday."
- "My first business failed in 3 months. I couldn't pay rent."

---

### 3. MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SEEN HOOK
**Psychology:** Acts as "a hug in text form." When people feel invisible or misunderstood, validating their experience creates instant connection and gratitude.

**Formula:**  
`[Describe a specific struggle/feeling your audience experiences but rarely talks about]`

**Requirements:**
- Be highly specific to your target audience's hidden pain
- Use empathetic, warm language
- Avoid judgment

**Examples:**
- "Nobody tells you how lonely entrepreneurship actually is"
- "You're not lazy. You're exhausted from pretending everything is fine."
- "That voice telling you you're not ready? Everyone has it."

---

### 4. STRONG DISAGREEMENT HOOK
**Psychology:** Polarization drives engagement. Calling out "BS" in your industry makes people stop scrolling—like watching a fight break out at a party.

**Formula:**  
`[Common belief/practice in your industry] is [wrong/BS/killing your results]`

**Requirements:**
- Attack a widely-held belief, not a person
- Be prepared to defend your position in the body
- The disagreement must be genuine, not manufactured

**Examples:**
- "Most LinkedIn advice is complete BS"
- "Hustle culture is destroying your productivity"
- "Your morning routine isn't the problem"

---

### 5. OPINION AS FACT HOOK
**Psychology:** Stating an opinion as an undeniable truth forces readers to stop and evaluate. It's a bold, confident move that commands attention.

**Formula:**  
`[Strong opinion] stated as absolute truth, with no hedging`

**Requirements:**
- No qualifiers (avoid "I think," "maybe," "in my opinion")
- Make it declarative and definitive
- Choose an opinion your audience will either strongly agree or disagree with

**Examples:**
- "Cold outreach is dead."
- "You don't need a personal brand. You need results."
- "The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing."

---

### 6. REBELLION STORY HOOK
**Psychology:** Taps into the universal inner rebel. Stories of defying authority or expectations are inherently compelling.

**Formula:**  
`I was told [not to do X / to do Y] + I did the opposite + [result]`

**Requirements:**
- Identify a rule, norm, or authority figure
- Show clear defiance
- Hint at a positive (or instructive) outcome

**Examples:**
- "Everyone told me not to quit my job. I did it anyway."
- "My mentor said this strategy would never work. It's now my #1 revenue source."
- "HR said I'd never get promoted. I became their boss."

---

### 7. TRIGGER FOMO HOOK
**Psychology:** Nobody wants to be left out. Playing "hard to get" with valuable information leverages curiosity and ambition.

**Formula:**  
`[Small group] knows [secret/strategy] that [most people/others] don't`

**Requirements:**
- Create a clear in-group/out-group dynamic
- The "secret" must sound valuable
- Imply the reader can join the in-group by reading

**Examples:**
- "Top 1% of founders all do this. The rest don't even know it exists."
- "This strategy is only taught in $10K masterminds"
- "Most marketers will never learn this because they're too focused on tactics"

---

### 8. TURNING THE TABLES HOOK
**Psychology:** Challenges the status quo and makes people question everything they thought they knew. Creates a "wake up" moment.

**Formula:**  
`What if [common belief] is actually [the opposite]?` or `[Common advice] is actually [hurting/wrong/backwards]`

**Requirements:**
- Identify conventional wisdom in your field
- Flip it completely
- The reversal must be defensible

**Examples:**
- "What if your biggest weakness is actually your superpower?"
- "Working harder is actually making you less productive"
- "The best time to raise prices is when you're losing clients"

---

### 9. SETTING A GOAL HOOK
**Psychology:** Showing your work-in-progress turns spectators into participants. Transparency with evidence proves achievability.

**Formula:**  
`I'm going to [specific goal] in [timeframe]. Here's my plan.`

**Requirements:**
- The goal must be specific and measurable
- Include a concrete timeframe
- Signal that you'll share the strategy/journey

**Examples:**
- "I'm going to get 10,000 newsletter subscribers in 90 days. Here's how."
- "My goal: $1M revenue this year. Starting from $0. Follow along."
- "I'm documenting my journey to 100K followers. Week 1 starts now."

---

### 10. SUBJECT MASTER CLASS HOOK
**Psychology:** Taps into the desire for quick wins combined with laziness. People want maximum results with minimum effort.

**Formula:**  
`Learn [valuable skill/insight] in [very short time]`

**Requirements:**
- Promise must be specific and valuable
- Time investment must be minimal (seconds to minutes)
- Deliver on the promise in the post body

**Examples:**
- "Learn to write hooks in 60 seconds"
- "The 30-second trick that doubled my response rate"
- "Master LinkedIn's algorithm in 2 minutes"

---

### 11. GOLDEN ADVICE HOOK
**Psychology:** Teasing life-changing advice creates irresistible curiosity. The promise of transformation hooks the mind.

**Formula:**  
`The [single/best/only] [advice/tip/lesson] that [dramatic result]`

**Requirements:**
- Frame as singular/superlative (best, only, single most important)
- Promise significant impact
- The advice must actually be valuable

**Examples:**
- "The single piece of advice that changed my career"
- "One sentence that made me a millionaire"
- "The only sales tip you'll ever need"

---

### 12. LEVERAGE FOFO HOOK (Fear Of F*cking Up)
**Psychology:** People are highly motivated to avoid mistakes. Warning them about "the worst advice" taps into real fear of failure.

**Formula:**  
`The worst [advice/mistake/thing you can do] in [field] is [specific thing]`

**Requirements:**
- Identify a common mistake or bad advice
- Frame it as dangerous or costly
- Imply you'll explain why and what to do instead

**Examples:**
- "The worst advice I ever followed cost me $50,000"
- "Stop doing this immediately—it's killing your engagement"
- "The #1 mistake new founders make (and how to avoid it)"

## Hook Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any hook, verify it meets these criteria:

| Criterion | Yes/No |
|-----------|--------|
| Is it 1-3 lines maximum? | |
| Does it trigger genuine curiosity? | |
| Is the topic clear within 2 seconds? | |
| Does it feel personally relevant to the target reader? | |
| Does it create a "curiosity gap" (reveals enough to intrigue but withholds the full story)? | |
| Is it specific (includes numbers, timeframes, or concrete details)? | |
| Does it avoid generic, overused phrases? | |
| Would YOU click "see more" if you saw this in your feed? | |

---

## Hook Failure Patterns to Avoid

| Failure Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| Too vague | "Here's some advice about marketing" | No curiosity gap, no specificity |
| Too long | More than 3 lines before "see more" | Key message gets cut off |
| No emotional trigger | "I have thoughts on productivity" | Doesn't make reader feel anything |
| Clickbait without substance | "You won't BELIEVE what happened" | Feels manipulative, erodes trust |
| No relevance signal | Hook doesn't indicate who it's for | Reader doesn't self-identify |
| Boring insight | "Hard work leads to success" | Not unique, everyone already knows this |
| Generic opening | "In today's world..." / "Have you ever..." | Overused, instantly forgettable |

---

## Structural Patterns for High-Performing Hooks

### Pattern A: Shock + Expansion
Line 1: Shocking or surprising statement  
Line 2: Brief expansion or emotional reaction  
Line 3: Transition to body ("Here's what happened" / "Here's why")

### Pattern B: Specific Claim
Line 1: Specific achievement or insight with numbers  
Line 2: Promise of value ("Here's the exact framework")

### Pattern C: Relatable Pain + Promise
Line 1: Acknowledge a specific pain point  
Line 2: Signal that a solution follows

### Pattern D: Contradiction
Line 1: State a common belief  
Line 2: Contradict it sharply

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Specificity beats generality** — "I made $47,000" beats "I made good money"
2. **Emotion drives clicks** — Fear, curiosity, aspiration, and validation are most powerful
3. **The hook is a promise** — The body must deliver on it
4. **One hook = one idea** — Don't try to pack multiple concepts into the hook
5. **Short sentences win** — Each line should be punchy and scannable
6. **Test ruthlessly** — If you wouldn't click it yourself, rewrite it
