## Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Gets to the point fast, no fluff | "The quality dropped." |
| **Conversational** | Writes like talking to a smart friend | "That was me" |
| **Bold** | Not afraid to challenge or be controversial | "I just canceled my ChatGPT subscription after defending it for 12 months straight." |
| **Self-aware** | Admits mistakes and learning moments | "Caught in the 'first version must have everything' trap" |

| **Founder-minded** | Speaks from builder's perspective | "When you pour your soul into a product..." |

---

## Writing Style Patterns

### Sentence Structure

**Short. Punchy. Rhythmic.**

Sentences are often 3-8 words. Paragraphs are 1-2 lines max. This creates easy scanning, dramatic pauses, and mobile-friendly reading.

### Line Breaks as Punctuation

Line breaks are used heavily to create breathing room, emphasize key points, and build rhythm and pacing. Treat line breaks like punctuation marks.

## Formatting Preferences

### Text Styling
- **Bold Unicode text** for headlines and key phrases
- Regular text for body content
- Minimal ALL CAPS (used sparingly for emphasis: "UNDERRATED", "BETTER")

### Emojis
- Used sparingly (1-3 per post max)
- Placed strategically, not decoratively
- Preferred emojis: strength, sweat smile, chart, arrow
- Often in parenthetical asides: "(That's up 25% since Feb 2025)"

### Lists
- Uses arrows for clean lists
- Numbered lists with ) not . for sequential steps
- Short items (one line each)

**Examples from posts:**
```
→ Traffic analytics for AI platforms
→ Optimized content pipelines for GPT
→ Systems to surface your product in AI answers
```

```
1) Killed a daily strike feature
2) Simplified the promo banner for new stories
3) Added title guidelines to fit cards better
```
