# Storytelling & Scriptwriting Guide

## The Foundation

**Emotional Investment** is key - the more emotionally invested, the less critical the audience becomes.

### Functional Storytelling (Angels' Cocktail)

Great storytelling triggers specific hormones:
- **Dopamine:** Suspense/cliffhangers -> Focus, motivation, memory
- **Oxytocin:** Empathy/vulnerability -> Trust, bonding, generosity
- **Endorphins:** Humor/laughter -> Relaxation, creativity

**Avoid:** Stress-inducing content releases cortisol -> intolerant, critical audience.

## Core Story Structures

### Five-Line Story Method
1. **Situation:** Starting point
2. **Desire:** What character wants
3. **Conflict:** What gets in the way
4. **Change:** Turning point
5. **Result:** New reality

### Three-Act Arc
Beginning -> Climactic Peak -> Resolution

### Somebody Wanted But So Then
- Somebody Wanted (motivation)
- But (conflict)
- So (solution)
- Then (resolution)

## Scripting Process

### 5-Step Framework (Kallaway)
1. **Packaging:** Title + thumbnail first
2. **Outline:** Bulleted points
3. **Intro:** Hook + curiosity loop
4. **Body:** Core content
5. **Outro:** High note + CTA

### HIVES Framework
- **H:** Hook (the promise)
- **I:** Intro (credibility)
- **V:** Value (points 1, 2, 3)
- **E/S:** End screen sales pitch

## Hook Rules

- Less than 30 seconds before viewer decides
- Visual hooks 10x more effective than audio

## Body Structure

### The Dance (Context and Conflict)
Use **"but"** and **"therefore"** instead of "and then."

### Value Loop
- **Context:** Say what it is
- **Application:** Say how to do it
- **Framing:** Say why it matters

### Open Loops
Present next step as more important than previous.

## Clarity & Delivery

- Target 6th-grade vocabulary
- Shorter, punchier sentences
- Active voice
- Conversational tone
- Overdo emotion on camera
- Relive stories, don't report them

## Advanced Tips

### Hiding the Vegetables
Make positive premises more consumable with flashy packaging.

### Start with End in Mind
Figure out desired emotion first, work backward.

### The Last Dab
Last line should be so memorable someone would share it with a friend.
